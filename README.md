# WGRegionTitles

Utilising the great work done by der_mewin with WGRegionEvents, I have created a plugin which adds to the functionality of WorldGuard to allow players to add titles to regions simply using WorldGuard's built in commands.

Commands

/region flag [region_id] greeting-title [Title Content]

/region flag [region_id] greeting-subtitle [Subtitle Content]

/region flag [region_id] farewell-title [Title Content]

/region flag [region_id] farewell-subtitle [Subtitle Content]

Clearing a title or subtitle is done in the same fashion as other WorldGuard flags. Simply do the command above but don't add the content parameter.

Standard Minecraft colours codes are supported.

This plugin requires WorldGuard 6.2+
